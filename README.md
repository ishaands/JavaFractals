# JavaFractals
<pre>
WIP visualization of various fractals with color gradients using Java.

In order to generate different Fractals, go to Fractals.java and replace the Strings on line 132: replacing
the first String changes the title, replacing the second String changes the fractal being generated.
Current possible combinations for the second String:
Circle
CircleRepeat
CircleDouble
CircleQuad
CircleGlitch1 - Not a fractal but a weird glitch
Square
SquareRepeat

Fractals being worked on:
Sierpinski Triangle
Cantor Lines
Mandelbrot Set
